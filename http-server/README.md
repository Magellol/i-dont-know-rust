# i-dont-know-rust

I've recently started to learn Rust and it's application in [WASM](https://webassembly.org/).
I'm just experimenting with the language and commit stuff in here.

### Disclaimer

Any code in this repo will either not work or be completely useless.
I'm still highly depending on tutorials while trying to go beyond and hack around. _I have no idea what I'm doing._
